# PhiloArduino
A prototype device implementing hedonistic calulator using an Arduino, a display and buttons.
 
# About PhiloArduino
In philosophy class, we had a thought experiment using Benthams when discussing utilitarism. This way, I learned about the hedonistic calulus.
As I started with programming Arduino to that time, I challenged myself to implement it using an Arduino.

# About the hedonistic calulus
Utilitarianism is the moral theory that an action is morally right if and only if it is productive of the most utility (happiness, pleasure) for the greatest number of persons. Bentham believed the right act is the act which of all those open to the agent, will actually or probably produce the greatest amount of pleasure in the world-at-large. Pleasure and pain form the basis of the standard of right and wrong.
 
Intensity    -- How intense is the pleasure or pain?  
Propinquity  -- How far off in the future is the pleasure or pain?  
Extent       -- How many persons are affected by the pleasure?  
Certainty    -- What is the probability that the pleasure or pain will occur?  
Purity       -- What is the probability that the pain will lead to other pains?
